## Purpose

I have a wooden puzzle that consists of a square base and buildings that are to be arranged on it.  All of the buildings only fit on it if they are arranged precisely; the object of the puzzle is to figure out what the arrangement needs to be.

Needless to say, I suck at this puzzle, and this is my attempt to write a computer program to solve it.
